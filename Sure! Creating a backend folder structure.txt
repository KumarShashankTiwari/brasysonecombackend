Sure! Creating a backend folder structure for a Node.js Express application with MongoDB for an e-commerce website involves structuring your code in a way that makes it scalable, maintainable, and organized.

Here's a simple folder structure that you can use as a starting point:

```plaintext
- /backend
    - /config
        - db.js // MongoDB connection configuration
    - /controllers
        - authController.js // Handles authentication related logic
        - productController.js // Handles product related logic
        - orderController.js // Handles order related logic
    - /models
        - user.js // User schema and model
        - product.js // Product schema and model
        - order.js // Order schema and model
    - /routes
        - authRoutes.js // Routes related to authentication
        - productRoutes.js // Routes related to products
        - orderRoutes.js // Routes related to orders
    - /middlewares
        - authMiddleware.js // Authentication middleware
    - app.js // Main entry point of the application
```

Here's a brief overview of what each directory contains:

1. `/config`: Contains configuration files, in this case `db.js` for setting up the MongoDB connection.

2. `/controllers`: Holds the logic for handling different aspects of the application, such as `authController.js` for authentication, `productController.js` for product-related logic, and `orderController.js` for order-related logic.

3. `/models`: Includes the data models for your application. Each model file, like `user.js`, `product.js`, and `order.js`, contains the schema and model definitions using a library like Mongoose for MongoDB.

4. `/routes`: Contains the route definitions for different parts of the application. For example, `authRoutes.js` would define the routes related to authentication, `productRoutes.js` for product-related routes, and `orderRoutes.js` for order-related routes.

5. `/middlewares`: Holds any custom middleware functions. In this case, `authMiddleware.js` would contain authentication-related middleware.

6. `app.js`: The main entry point of the application where you would set up the Express server, connect to the database, and define any global middleware.

In each of the files, you'd define the specific logic for the corresponding part of the application, such as handling user authentication, CRUD operations for products, and processing orders.

This is a basic structure, and as the application grows, you might want to organize and modularize the code further. For example, you could create subdirectories within `/controllers` and `/routes` to group related functionality together.

I hope this gives you a good starting point for organizing your Node.js Express application with MongoDB for an e-commerce website!
